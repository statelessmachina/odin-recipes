    <p class="section-title">Description</p>
    <p>A delicious pan-cooked cod. This recipe would go perfect with cooked asparagus</p>
    <p class="section-title">Ingredients</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon pepper</li>
        <li>1 (3 ounce) fillet cod, or more to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dry white wine</li>
        <li>(Optional) 1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese, or to taste </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="section-title">Steps</p>
    <ol>
        <li> Heat olive oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat; cook and stir onion, garlic, and lemon pepper until onion is slightly tender, about 3 minutes. Add cod to the frying pan, flipping the cod over to coat both sides with oil.</li>
        <li>Cook cod in the onion mixture until it flakes easily with a fork, occasionally sliding fish around so it doesn't stick, about 4 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Pour wine into the frying pan and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Slide the cod around the pan, flip it over, and slide around again until coated in wine, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Transfer cod to a serving plate; top with onion mixture and Parmesan cheese.</li>
    </ol>
